After recently graduating from [Salem State University](https://www.salemstate.edu/) with a major in computer science and a double minor in math and physics, It is finally time to take on what ive been hiding from, moving out my moms basement. On a more serious note, college always felt like a burden on my back and this annoying thing i had to do to be successful in life. While doing it, i came to a realization that it wasnt the case. No matter what route you decided to take in life, you need only two things to be 'very' successful, hardwork and consistency (as long as it is legal of course).

# Next Steps

I landed a role as a Cloud engineer at a very exciting company, apart from my love of SWE and the cloud, i preferred this role over a traditional new grad software engineering position for 2 main reasons:

- Compensation
- The team

I think my first reason is self explanatory and one can allude to the reason/s why. The second reason not so much. After completing a ~8 month SWE internship with the engineering team, i loved the work environment, ethic and mindset. I had the opportunity of working with really smart people with tons of experience which in turn set high expectations from me. This motivated me to work (grind) even harder. I was incharge of all technical decisions on anything i built which was great. These metrics all played a crucial role in me signing a full time offer
With all of that being said, i have a hard career goal of becoming a millionaire my 25 (currently 21 with $300 in my bank account) and I intend to pursue my goal of entrepreneurship in the tech space, focusing on startups, SaaS, etc. Over the next few years, i will be locked in my room working towards that goal outside my day job.
